## üí° **Pro Tips for Your Agent**

1. **Always use the latest year available:**
   ```sql
   WHERE year = (SELECT MAX(year) FROM table)
   ```

2. **Join datasets for richer insights:**
   - ADI + Census ACS = Socioeconomic picture
   - Air Quality + Census = Environmental justice analysis
   - Health Rankings + Demographics = Health equity assessment

3. **Use geographic joins:**
   ```sql
   -- Join by zip code
   JOIN ON zipcode = geo_id
   
   -- Join by state
   JOIN ON state_name = state
   ```

4. **Filter for recent data:**
   ```sql
   WHERE date_local >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
   ```

5. **Aggregate for trends:**
   ```sql
   GROUP BY state_name, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date_local)
   ORDER BY year DESC
   ```

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

To test these queries:
1. Restart ADK web: `adk web`
2. Select `data_agent`
3. Ask natural language questions like:
   - **"Show me free dental clinics in California counties with high uninsured rates"** ‚≠ê
   - **"Find sliding scale dental clinics in Los Angeles"** ‚≠ê
   - **"What are the chronic disease rates in California?"** ‚≠ê
   - "What zip codes in California have the highest area deprivation index?"
   - "Show me PM2.5 air quality trends for Los Angeles in the last month"
   - "Which California hospitals have the best performance ratings?"

Your agent will automatically translate these to SQL using the datasets above!
