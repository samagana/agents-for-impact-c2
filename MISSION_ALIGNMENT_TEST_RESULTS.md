# Mission Alignment Test Results
## Community Health & Wellness Advisor - API Testing

**Test Date:** October 16, 2025  
**API Server:** `http://localhost:8000`  
**Testing Method:** ADK API Server with streaming SSE endpoints

## 🎯 **Mission from Challenge Document**

**The Challenge:**
Health disparities are exacerbated by scattered, inaccessible, and complex public health data. Community health staff need **immediate, synthesized intelligence** to make informed, protective decisions.

**Your Mission:**
Develop a multi-agent system to provide **conversational, hyper-local, and actionable health intelligence** to public health staff, community organizations, and residents.

## 🧪 **Mission Use Case Testing**

### **Use Case 1: Dental Clinics for Uninsured Populations** ⭐
**Mission Question:** *"Show me free or low-cost dental clinics in close proximity to the highest uninsured populations"*

**Dataset Used:** `qwiklabs-gcp-04-91797af16116.dental.dental_data`

**Result:**
- ✅ Agent accessed the dental clinic dataset
- ✅ Correctly filtered for `free_services=TRUE` and `sliding_scale=TRUE`
- ✅ Ordered by `uninsured_rate` to prioritize high-need areas
- ⚠️ No California data in dataset (has TX, NC, SD, etc.)
- ✅ Agent adapted and offered to show nationwide results

**Sample Query Generated:**
```sql
SELECT 
    county, state, clinic_name, clinic_address,
    clinic_phone, clinic_services,
    accepts_uninsured, free_services, sliding_scale,
    uninsured_rate, uninsured_count, total_population
FROM `qwiklabs-gcp-04-91797af16116.dental.dental_data`
WHERE (free_services = TRUE OR sliding_scale = TRUE)
    AND state = 'CA'
ORDER BY uninsured_rate DESC, distance_miles ASC
```

**Alignment with Mission:** 🎯 **EXCELLENT**
- Direct answer to challenge question
- Combines healthcare access + socioeconomic data
- Actionable results (addresses, phone numbers)
- Hyper-local (county-level)

---

### **Use Case 2: Air Quality Comparison** 🌫️
**Mission Question:** *"How's the air quality today compared to last week?"*

**Datasets Used:** 
- `qwiklabs-gcp-04-91797af16116.global_aq.global_aq_data`
- `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm25_frm_daily_summary`

**Result:**
- ✅ Agent understood the temporal comparison request
- ✅ Tried global air quality dataset first
- ✅ Fell back to EPA historical data
- ✅ Generated date-range queries correctly
- ⚠️ Hit data freshness limitation (EPA is historical, not real-time)
- ✅ Explained limitations to user

**Sample Query Generated:**
```sql
SELECT
    date_local AS date,
    AVG(arithmetic_mean) AS avg_pm25
FROM `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm25_frm_daily_summary`
WHERE city_name = 'Los Angeles'
    AND date_local >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 8 DAY)
GROUP BY date
ORDER BY date DESC
```

**Alignment with Mission:** 🎯 **GOOD**
- Correct approach to temporal analysis
- Used appropriate health metric (PM2.5)
- Limited by data freshness, not agent capability
- **Recommendation:** Integrate real-time API (AirNow) for current data

---

### **Use Case 3: Mobile Clinic Deployment** 🏥
**Mission Question:** *"What are the top five zip codes where we should prioritize mobile health clinic deployment based on poverty levels?"*

**Datasets Available:**
- `bigquery-public-data.broadstreet_adi.area_deprivation_index_by_zipcode`
- `bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_acs.zip_codes_2018_5yr`
- `qwiklabs-gcp-04-91797af16116.cal_hosp_ratings` (hospitals by location)

**Expected Query:**
```sql
SELECT 
    zipcode,
    area_deprivation_index_percent,
    description
FROM `bigquery-public-data.broadstreet_adi.area_deprivation_index_by_zipcode`
WHERE year = (SELECT MAX(year) FROM `bigquery-public-data.broadstreet_adi.area_deprivation_index_by_zipcode`)
    AND zipcode LIKE '9%' -- California zip codes start with 9
ORDER BY area_deprivation_index_percent DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Alignment with Mission:** 🎯 **EXCELLENT**
- Direct dataset match (ADI measures socioeconomic disadvantage)
- Hyper-local (zip code level)
- Actionable for resource allocation
- Combines multiple socioeconomic indicators
